# BracketHighlighter 2.21.1

If you are on ST3 3116+, BH now Requires mdpopups 1.9.1.  Sorry for causing  
panic.  If you are on a version less than 3116, it does not need mdpopups as  
it cannot use it.

For those who are on 3116+ it is advised that if 
`Preferences->Package Settings->BracketHighlighter->Support Info`  
does not show that 1.9.1 is installed, that you should run Package Control's
`Satisfy Dependency` command.

Please see `Preferences->Package Settings->BracketHighlighter->Changelog`  
for more info about the release.
